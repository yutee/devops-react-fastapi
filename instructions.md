# Full-Stack FastAPI and React Template - DevOps November CV Challenge

Welcome to the **Full-Stack FastAPI and React Template** repository! This project serves as a demo application for the **DevOps November Resume Challenge**, where participants will deploy a full-stack application with a **FastAPI** backend and **ReactJS** frontend using **ChakraUI**. Additionally, participants will set up monitoring and logging tools, configure a reverse proxy, and deploy the application to a cloud platform, showcasing their end-to-end DevOps skills.

---

## Challenge Overview

As part of this challenge, your primary goal is to:

1. Dockerize a full-stack application with a FastAPI backend and React frontend.
2. Configure and deploy monitoring and logging tools including Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Promtail, and cAdvisor.
3. Set up a reverse proxy for application routing.
4. Deploy the application to a cloud platform with proper domain configuration.
5. Submit a working repository with detailed documentation and screenshots of your deployed application.

## Challenge Requirements

1. **Dockerization and Orchestration**:  
   - Write `Dockerfile`s to containerize both the **React frontend** and **FastAPI backend**.
   - Create two `docker-compose.yml` files:
     1. **Application Stack Compose**:  
        Orchestrate the following services:
        - React frontend.
        - FastAPI backend.
        - PostgreSQL database.
        - Adminer (for database management).
        - Reverse Proxy (Traefik or Nginx Proxy Manager).
     2. **Monitoring Stack Compose**:  
        Orchestrate the following services:
        - Prometheus.
        - Grafana.
        - Loki and Promtail.
        - **cAdvisor** for monitoring container performance.
     - Ensure both Docker Compose files are connected to a common Docker network to allow inter-container communication.

2. **Reverse Proxy Configuration**:  
   Use **Traefik** or **Nginx Proxy Manager** in the **Application Stack Compose** to:
   - Serve the **frontend** on `/` (the root path).
   - Proxy `/api` to the FastAPI backend.
   - Proxy `/docs` to the FastAPI backend's Swagger documentation.
   - Proxy `/prometheus` to the Prometheus web UI (via the Monitoring Stack).
   - Proxy `/grafana` to the Grafana web UI (via the Monitoring Stack).
   - Ensure all routes are properly secured and accessible.

3. **Database Configuration**:  
   - Use PostgreSQL as the backend database.
   - Configure Adminer for database management and ensure it is accessible via `db.domain`.

4. **Monitoring and Logging**:  
   - Set up the following tools using the **Monitoring Stack Compose**:
     - **Prometheus** for collecting application metrics.
     - **Grafana** for visualizing metrics and logs.
     - **Loki** and **Promtail** for log aggregation and forwarding.
     - **cAdvisor** to monitor container metrics and performance.
   - Ensure Prometheus is scraping metrics from the backend, and Grafana is configured with dashboards for logs and metrics.
   - Ensure that all monitoring dashboards (Prometheus, Grafana, and cAdvisor) are routed through the reverse proxy (Traefik or Nginx Proxy Manager) in the **Application Stack Compose**.
   - Create a cAdvisor Dashboard in Grafana**:
     - Integrate **cAdvisor** with **Grafana** to display container performance metrics such as CPU usage, memory usage, disk I/O, and network I/O.
     - Create a custom Grafana dashboard that visualizes container metrics from cAdvisor.
     - Ensure the dashboard has proper panels for the most important container metrics.

   - Add Loki as a Data Source in Grafana**:
     - Integrate **Loki** into **Grafana** to enable log aggregation and visualization.
     - Ensure that **Loki** is set up as a data source in **Grafana** and logs from the application and containers are sent to it.
     - Include a panel in Grafana that visualizes logs from Loki, which could be useful for troubleshooting or monitoring application performance.

5. **Cloud Deployment**:  
   - Deploy the application stack to a cloud platform (AWS, GCP, or Azure) using Docker Compose.
   - Set up a domain for your application (e.g., `your-app.domain.com`).
   - If you donâ€™t have a domain, obtain a free subdomain from [Afraid DNS](https://freedns.afraid.org/).
   - Configure:
     - HTTP to redirect to HTTPS.
     - `www` to redirect to the non-`www` domain.

6. **Article**:  
   - Write and publish a detailed **Article** about the project. Your article should include:
     - An overview of the project and its purpose.
     - Step-by-step instructions on how you containerized, orchestrated, and deployed the application.
     - Screenshots of your setup, including:
       - The deployed application.
       - Grafana dashboards showing metrics and logs.
       - Reverse proxy configuration.
     - Challenges you faced and how you resolved them.
     - Lessons learned and tips for others.
   - Include the link to your Medium article in your submission.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **frontend**: Contains the ReactJS application.
- **backend**: Contains the FastAPI application and PostgreSQL database integration.

Each directory includes its own README file with detailed instructions:

- [Frontend README](./frontend/README.md)
- [Backend README](./backend/README.md)

---

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

Start by cloning this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
```


## Testing and Evaluation

Your hosted application will be evaluated based on the following criteria:  

1. **Dockerization**:  
   - Verify that the `Dockerfile`s and `docker-compose.yml` work seamlessly to build and run the application.  

2. **Reverse Proxy**:  
   - Confirm that the application routes are correctly configured (frontend on `/`, backend `/api`, and backend docs `/docs`).  

3. **Database Setup**:  
   - Ensure PostgreSQL is properly configured and Adminer is accessible via `db.domain`.  

4. **Monitoring and Logging**:  
   - Test that Prometheus scrapes application metrics and Grafana displays metrics and logs.
   - Ensure that cAdvisor metrics are displayed properly in the Grafana dashboard.
   - Ensure that Logs from Loki Can be visualized in Grafana.

5. **Cloud Deployment**:  
   - Confirm the application is deployed to the cloud and accessible via a public URL.  
   - Check that HTTP redirects to HTTPS, and `www` redirects to the non-`www` domain.  

6. **Repository Validation**:  
   - Verify that running `docker-compose up -d` from your repository correctly deploys the application and all supporting services.  

7. **Article**:  
   - Evaluate the clarity, detail, and technical depth of the published article.
